This project aims to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) powered system for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The system will utilize deep learning techniques to analyze X-ray images and identify patterns indicative of pneumonia, assisting doctors and medical professionals in diagnosing and treating the disease more accurately and efficiently.

Objectives:

1. Develop a deep learning model to classify X-ray images as pneumonia or non-pneumonia
2. Achieve high accuracy and sensitivity in detecting pneumonia
3. Create a user-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing X-ray images
4. Integrate the system with existing healthcare infrastructure for seamless adoption

Methodology:

1. Data Collection: Gather a large dataset of labeled chest X-ray images (pneumonia and non-pneumonia)
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean, resize, and normalize images for model training
3. Model Development: Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using the preprocessed data
4. Model Evaluation: Test and validate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall
5. Deployment: Develop a web-based interface for uploading X-ray images and displaying diagnosis results
